#### 2. Core Symbols

- **Tomb Symbol (Wild & Scatter):**
  - **Wild:** Substitutes for all regular symbols to complete winning combinations on active paylines
  - **Scatter:** 3+ Tomb symbols anywhere on the reels trigger 10 Free Spins. Scatter wins pay independently of paylines and are multiplied by the total bet (see paytable for exact values)

- **High Symbols:**
  - **Rich Wilde (Adventurer)**: 5× = 500× bet, 4× = 100× bet, 3× = 10× bet, 2× = 1× bet
  - **Pharaoh (Golden Mask)**: 5× = 200× bet, 4× = 40× bet, 3× = 4× bet, 2× = 0.5× bet
  - **Anubis (Jackal-headed god), Horus (Falcon god)**: 5× = 75× bet, 4× = 10× bet, 3× = 3× bet, 2× = 0.5× bet

- **Low Symbols:** Stylized card symbols **A, K, Q, J, 10** (Egyptian-themed with golden outlines)
  - **A, K**: 5× = 15× bet, 4× = 4× bet, 3× = 0.5× bet
  - **Q, J, 10**: 5× = 10× bet, 4× = 2.5× bet, 3× = 0.5× bet

#### 3. Key Mechanics

- **Free Spins Feature:** Landing 3 or more Tomb Scatter symbols anywhere on the reels triggers 10 Free Spins. Before Free Spins begin, one symbol (excluding the Tomb) is randomly selected as the Expanding Symbol. When this symbol lands on reels during Free Spins, it expands to cover the entire reel, dramatically increasing win potential

- **Gamble (optional):** After a win, players can risk the payout for x2 (Color) or x4 (Suit)

#### 4. Win Profile

- High volatility slot; most win potential sits in the Free Spins feature
- Expanding Symbol full-reel hits can drive large multi-line payouts
